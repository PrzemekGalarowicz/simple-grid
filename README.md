How does it work
It’s very simple! Here's how the Simple Grid - Framework grid system works:
Rows must be placed within a .container (80% width) or .container-fluid (100% width). It uses .row to determine the horizontal column groups. Columns (eg .col-6 ,.col-8) must be in .row. This is a must! Columns don’t have a default paddings. If you want to achieve them, use the class .box inside the column. Class .box has the default paddings set to 20px. Look to the examples for applying these principles to your code.
